            <li>When you're overwhelmed: OneSpark simplifies.</li>

          <h2>FAQ</h2>

          <details>
            <summary><strong>What makes OneSpark different from regular headphones?</strong></summary>
            <p>Unlike traditional headphones that just play audio, OneSpark responds to your brain in real-time. Using EEG sensors and adaptive AI, it personalizes your content based on your attention level, helping you stay focused, learn faster, and enjoy content that fits your mental rhythm.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary><strong>How does OneSpark track my attention? Is it safe?</strong></summary>
            <p>OneSpark uses non-invasive EEG technology to capture brainwave activity from the ear canal. It's safe, painless, and clinically backed. We never record or share raw brain data—your privacy and peace of mind are core to our values.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary><strong>Can I use OneSpark with my existing content apps like Spotify, YouTube, or Audible?</strong></summary>
            <p>At launch, OneSpark works with our companion MyBrain App, which includes curated adaptive content experiences. We are actively exploring integrations and plan to expand compatibility with third-party platforms in future updates.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary><strong>What does the MyBrain App do?</strong></summary>
            <p>MyBrain is your adaptive content hub that works together with the OneSpark headphones. It enables you to store your favourite content and get it personalized to your brain in real-time. It also offers personalized dashboard for tracking attention levels, reviewing learning trends, and getting content suggestions based on your focus profile. It helps you understand how your brain behaves—and how to make it work for you.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary><strong>What about sound quality and battery life?</strong></summary>
            <p>OneSpark is engineered with premium audio components: high-fidelity sound, intelligent noise isolation, and 20+ hours of battery life. We've built it to perform as an exceptional pair of headphones.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary><strong>Who is OneSpark for?</strong></summary>
            <p>OneSpark is designed for learners, knowledge workers, creators, neurodivergent minds, and anyone who feels overwhelmed or distracted in the digital world. If you've ever struggled to stay focused or felt guilty for zoning out—OneSpark is for you.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary><strong>Is my data secure?</strong></summary>
            <p>Absolutely. We never sell or share your brain data. All information is encrypted and used only to enhance your personal experience. You're always in control—and can opt out of data tracking at any time.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary><strong>When will I receive my OneSpark headphones?</strong></summary>
            <p>We aim to start shipping by Q4 2025. Backers will receive regular updates as we move through final testing and production.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary><strong>Can I use OneSpark without the app?</strong></summary>
            <p>Yes! You can use OneSpark as high-quality headphones even without the app. But to unlock the smart features—attention tracking, adaptive content, and insights—you'll need the MyBrain App.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary><strong>How can headphones in my ears read brainwaves?</strong></summary>
            <p>Brain signals spread across your entire head—including the ear canal. Mini EEG sensors in each earpiece pick up those patterns—no bulky headband needed.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary><strong>Is it really rewriting content on the fly?</strong></summary>
            <p>Yes—think of it as "smart remixing." The AI trims, rephrases, or re‑orders segments so the story stays intact but the delivery matches your focus and mood.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary><strong>What signals tell Neocore I'm zoning out?</strong></summary>
            <p>Our models monitor attention‑related EEG markers (e.g., shifting alpha, theta, and beta patterns). When engagement dips, the AI steps in.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary><strong>Will I notice when it tweaks the content?</strong></summary>
            <p>Only if you want to. Keep it invisible or get a quick chime right before each adjustment.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary><strong>Does it learn my habits over time?</strong></summary>
            <p>Absolutely. Neocore builds a private, on‑device profile of your attention patterns, so its tweaks get smarter every session.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></summary>
